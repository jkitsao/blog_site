Images  create visual interest on content they help you to attract attention and to guide your visitor's line of sight and can be of great value when it comes to presenting important information

In this article, we’ll cover a good number of  websites that provide high quality  images that you can use for free

"Pexel Perfect: This is the only stock photo/video site I've needed."
What do you like best?
Obviously the Creative Commons licensing is great; the selection is decent (certainly for the price, and even price notwithstanding the selection is solid overall). The inclusion of video a year or so ago was a game changer as well; the clip selection isn't mind-blowing but you can usually find something close to what you need unless you're an absolute power user or have a very specific need.

What do you dislike?
The selection can feel limited if you're looking for abstractions or representations ("sad person," "learning," etc.) - you'll also start to notice similar stock photos used around the web if you lean on Pexels photos too too much, so your content may not stand out if you're distributing widely.

What problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realized?
We are improving design and visual appeal on online courses while avoiding copyright/intellectual property issues; also enhancing internal communications and reports. Pexels is a good meta-tool for starting conversations about open resources in education and is user-friendly for faculty members who want to create their own learning resources in combination with other tools (pulling stock video or photos from Pexels into Adobe Spark, for instance).

Being a graphic and website designer for many years I was impressed with the amount of diverse photo content the site offers. It makes my life as a designer easier knowing I can use high-quality images without the fear of breaking any copyright laws. Most of the images come in larger sizes so it's easy to use them for print work and I can easily scale them down in photoshop for web-based work.

You can use our pictures for just about anything — your website, blog or online store, school projects, Instagram ads, facebook posts, desktop backgrounds, client work and more. All our photos are free for commercial use with no attribution required; you can read more about this on our license page.

Are these photos free for commercial use?
Yes! In fact, we’d highly encourage it, as many of our collections were created with entrepreneurs in mind. You can use these free photos on your online store, product packaging, or anywhere else you’d like. You can even use these pics to create t-shirts, mugs, or other products.

Do I need to credit the site or photographer?
Our photographers appreciate getting credit for their work because it helps share their photography with more people, so we’d encourage you to do so whenever possible. You can give credit by linking back to the original photo page or the photographer's Burst profile (e.g. “Photo by Matthew Henry from Burst”). We realize it's not always possible to provide attribution, so it is not mandatory under our image license.

How do I download free photos?
When you hover over or click on an image, you will see "High Resolution" and "Low Resolution" download options. "Low Res" images are great for small web graphics, where file sizes need to be very compressed. "High Res" images are better for presentations, websites, online stores, and anywhere else where quality matters most.

Can I use these photographs for offline marketing campaigns?
Of course. We’d be honored to have you feature our free stock photos on a billboard, flyer, menu or catalog.
