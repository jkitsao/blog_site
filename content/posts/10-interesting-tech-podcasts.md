Over the past year i've found myself consuming more and more digital audio content(podcasts) 
unlike video and other  content sources  Once you subscribe to a podcast feed, new podcasts are automatically downloaded to your device as soon as they are available. You can listen to them at your convenience.

## Why even Bother listening to podcasts

studies show that the brain is more active while listening to podcasts than when watching television.
Podcasts, much like videos, require no reading and little energy, however, they donâ€™t cause the same visual strain or mental numbness as videos.

Plus technically listening to podcasts is a hobby why not try a new hobby
