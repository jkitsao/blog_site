"Pexel Perfect: This is the only stock photo/video site I've needed."
What do you like best?
Obviously the Creative Commons licensing is great; the selection is decent (certainly for the price, and even price notwithstanding the selection is solid overall). The inclusion of video a year or so ago was a game changer as well; the clip selection isn't mind-blowing but you can usually find something close to what you need unless you're an absolute power user or have a very specific need.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike?
The selection can feel limited if you're looking for abstractions or representations ("sad person," "learning," etc.) - you'll also start to notice similar stock photos used around the web if you lean on Pexels photos too too much, so your content may not stand out if you're distributing widely.

What problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realized?
We are improving design and visual appeal on online courses while avoiding copyright/intellectual property issues; also enhancing internal communications and reports. Pexels is a good meta-tool for starting conversations about open resources in education and is user-friendly for faculty members who want to create their own learning resources in combination with other tools (pulling stock video or photos from Pexels into Adobe Spark, for instance).

Being a graphic and website designer for many years I was impressed with the amount of diverse photo content the site offers. It makes my life as a designer easier knowing I can use high-quality images without the fear of breaking any copyright laws. Most of the images come in larger sizes so it's easy to use them for print work and I can easily scale them down in photoshop for web-based work.

What do you like best?

**Disadvantage?**

You may not find any result for many important and widely used keywords, means less image stock than paid ones. Each image can't be downloaded in the illustrator or svg format. There are pre defined sizes of each image, you have to choose the size out of these only.

There are millions of graphics but even we might not get what we expect. There is no matching result for so many topics. Last but not the least vector format is not available for all images.

**Advantage?**

Pixabay is one of the best Free Graphics stock market. It offers free uses of it's downloaded graphics even for commercial use. The best thing with Pixabay is that we do not have to credit anyone while using it. Graphics are also of high quality.


The best thing of Pixabay is it's licensing, they do not stop you to use their stock images for commercial use. You can use these images or photos from personal to commercial use without paying anything. They appreciate the attribution but it is even not forced, like other online tools.

[**StockSnap**](https://stocksnap.io/) is built on a very simple premise: They promise  users an ever-expanding collection of the best, most beautiful stock images for free. And  offer these images under a single, simple CC0 license that lets you do what you want with all our photos, with no attribution required.No more hassle trying to figure out whether you can use photos for commercial use and whether you need to provide attribution. 

**Disadvantage?**

For some areas such as (finance and business) there often are very few, if any, good relevant images to choose from. Sometimes, there's just nothing that will work, which is frustrating and leaves me looking elsewhere.

**Advantage?**

The Creative Commons CC0 license allows you to use all of the photos from StockSnap for free without providing attribution to the photographers. Although it is not required, it's always appreciated when you can provide attribution.

Aside from being able to contribute photos, creating an account on StockSnap allows you to favorite photos. This allows you to save all your favorite photos in one place without having to download them all at once.

Yes! In fact, we’d highly encourage it, as many of our collections were created with entrepreneurs in mind. You can use these free photos on your online store, product packaging, or anywhere else you’d like. You can even use these pics to create t-shirts, mugs, or other products.

**Do I need to credit the site or photographer?**

 You can give credit by linking back to the original photo page or the photographer's Burst profile (e.g. “Photo by Matthew Henry from Burst”). We realize it's not always possible to provide attribution, so it is not mandatory under their image license.

**How do I download free photos?**

When you hover over or click on an image, you will see "High Resolution" and "Low Resolution" download options. "Low Res" images are great for small web graphics, where file sizes need to be very compressed. "High Res" images are better for presentations, websites, online stores, and anywhere else where quality matters most.
