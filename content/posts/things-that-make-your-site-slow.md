A study says that website loading in 1.7 seconds is faster than 75% of all global websites while one loading in 5 seconds is faster than 25% of all global websites. Going by these industry stats, a loading time of two to four seconds is considered ideal for any business website. Even a one or two-second delay in loading time can have an adverse impact on customer engagement and generated revenues. 

For example, eCommerce retailer Amazon estimates that a one-second delay in webpage loading can cost over $1.6 billion in lost revenues every year.

On the other hand, by making their webpage load 2.2 seconds faster, internet browser company Mozilla recorded an increase of 60 million browser downloads in a year.

In other words, slow websites are bad news for business in multiple ways
